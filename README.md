# Instant Sounds JS
An implementation in HTML5 of the classic instant sound button app.

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcrobledo/instant-sounds-js/refs/heads/master/assets/preview.png)

It's easily customizable, so you can create your own sound button app quickly just by following a [simple file structure](https://github.com/marcrobledo/instant-sounds-js/blob/master/instant-sounds.example.js).<br/>
You can upload it anywhere and install it as a Progressive Web App.

This is a very old project of mine. Ten years later, I wasn't proud of my ugly code, so I rewrote it with my current web development skills.

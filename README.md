# Instant Sounds JS
An implementation in HTML5 of the classic instant sound button app.

It's easily customizable, so you can add your own audio clips (and groups) just by following a simple file structure.
You can upload it anywhere and install it as a Progressive Web App.

This is a very old project of mine, I am not very proud of the code today, but it still a fun app and a nice proof of concept.
